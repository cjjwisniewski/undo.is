When I was told that I was going to have the opportunity to attend Microsoft Ignite 
earlier this year, I was really excited. Not only was I going to get the chance to 
escape the bitter Pennsylvania cold, but I'd also get the chance to learn a ton and 
experiment with Microsoft's cutting-edge tech. Monday started off strong with Satya's 
Vision Keynote; Satya is a brilliant speaker, and the announcements this year were 
everything I could have hoped for. While I'd hardly consider Microsoft Endpoint
Manager to be something 'new,' I'm very happy thaty they're finally unifying their
branding all the same. Microsoft has been very vocal about the future of endpoint 
management in the enterprise being co-management, but SCCM and Intune have seemingly
always been treated as two completely unrelated products. With any luck this will 
eventually lead to simultaneous feature availability and, eventually, to the fabled
single pane of glass for endpoint management. 

I was also very interested in the applications of Project Cortex and in what they're 
doing with Power Automate (formerly Flow). While Cortex is only capable of scraping
your 365 stack currently, the (confirmed) plans for third-party connectors are very
exciting. Nobody <i>likes</i> writing documentation, so imagine if you could have 
the power of machine learning write KB articles for you after having scanned your 
ServiceNow instance for common issues. Think of a world where you are notified about
about a major issue before your help desk even knows it's happening. That would
be amazing enough, and that's before we start to get into the other applications of 
this sort of tech. If you already have something scraping your 365 stack for
reoccurrances of certain keywords, there's no reason why you couldn't be automatically 
alerted if people outside of a given department start talking about potentially classified
information. We were also shown the TruGreen demo about 100 times through the course of the 
week, but honestly it was probably warranted. Flow/Power Automate has always been a really
cool piece of tech, but now that it can easily integrate with legacy LoB applications
I can foresee much wider adoption. 

The sessions I attended mostly lined up with what I could see myself using in the workplace; 
I put a heavy emphasis on MEM and the Azure endpoint security features, with a sprinkling of 
other topics as I could make time for them. I learned a ton about what's coming down the pipeline
with Autopilot, with Azure Active Directory, and with a slew of other technologies that I'm 
really looking forward to implementing. And, of course, when I wasn't in sessions, I spent a 
lot of time talking to vendors (both ones we work with currently and new ones) in The Hub.

Microsoft is far from the only company that makes annoucements during Ignite, and I was 
happy to have the opportunity to get demos on some of the other stuff released during the
week. The wonderful people at Citrix provided us with a great demo on their Intelligent Workspace,
which I've always been really curious about. Our HRIS system at work is far from easy to work with, 
so the possibility of integrating "microapps" for common uses like inputting PTO or timesheets 
into something that our users are already familiar with sounds awesome. We also had a great talk 
with the Program Lead for Windows Update for Business at a Microsoft-sponsored social one night that
was hugely informative; as I'm in the process of implementing WuFB in our environment currently,
it was great to have her validate some of my concerns and confirm that my approach is following
best practices. 

All in all, Ignite was an incredible experience, and I'd love to do it again next year. In the meantime,
though, I'm going to do my best to apply what I've learned so that we can use this new tech as a stepping 
stone to what's coming in the future! See you next year, Orlando!
